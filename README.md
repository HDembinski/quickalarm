The Laziest Alarm Clock on the Web: Two-click alarm clock for Ubuntu

Quickalarm adds a small icon to the Ubuntu title bar. Set alarms by clicking on the icon, which produces a drop-down list of alarm times. Click on the appropriate time and the alarm is set. The alarm produces a sound and a pop-up.

Once an alarm is set, you can change or cancel it by clicking on the icon again and choosing another time or `Stop`.
